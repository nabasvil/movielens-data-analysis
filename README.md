# Movie Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes and visualizes the MovieLens dataset using Python. It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques. The project is structured for clarity and reproducibility, making it suitable for showcasing on GitHub.


## Project Structure
- `src/` : Source code and notebooks
- `data/` : Raw data files (not included in the repository)
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies
- `.gitignore` : Files and folders to ignore in git

## Data Files
**Note:** The CSV data files are not included in this repository due to their size. To run the analysis, download the following files and place them in the `data/` folder:

- `movies.csv`
- `links.csv`
- `ratings.csv`
- `tags.csv`
